Makes browsing YouTube quicker by opening videos in a popup when their thumbnails are clicked. InstantView also helps reduce the amount of YouTube tabs opened at a given time by allowing you to watch videos on the current page without the fear of losing your place.

Features
  • Popup to quickly view videos, playlists, comments, and descriptions
  • Mini player (picture in picture)
  • Visualizations
  • Many different options to customize look and behavior
  • Open Source (https://github.com/afrmtbl/InstantView)

Latest Update: 4.5.3
  FIXES
  - Video information may fail to load (again!). This was due to new security features introduced in Chrome 76 causing network requests to fail.

The full version history can be found on GitHub.
